# Insertion-Sort-Algorithm
 The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. 
 Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
   
   *This algorithm is one of the simplest algorithm with simple implementation

   *Basically, Insertion sort is efficient for small data values
   
   *Insertion sort is adaptive in nature, i.e. it is appropriate for data sets which are already partially sorted
   
   This algorithm is implemented with forward iterators and provides work with almost STL containers.
